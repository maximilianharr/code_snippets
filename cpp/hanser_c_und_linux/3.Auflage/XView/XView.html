<b>NAME</b>
       xview - xview toolkit information

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       There  is  no  xview  command per se, but this manual page
       will briefly describe XView features and functions.

<b>AVAILABILITY</b>
       XView is available with the OpenWindows distribution.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       XView (X Window-System-based Visual/Integrated Environment
       for  Workstations)  is an Open Look user-interface toolkit
       which supports development of interactive,  graphics-based
       applications  running  under  the  X  Window  System.  For
       detailed information see the XView Programming Manual  and
       the XView Reference Manual.

<b>USAGE</b>
   Compiling XView Programs
       XView  programs  are  compiled  with the following command
       line:

       cc sourcefile.c -o outputfile -lxview -lolgx -lX11


   Generic XView Functions
       xv_init()      Establishes the connection to  the  server,
                      initializes    the    Notifier    and   the
                      Defaults/Resource-Manager  database,  loads
                      the Server Resource-Manager database, reads
                      any  passed  attributes,  and  installs   a
                      default X11 Errorhandler.

                      Xv_Server
                      xv_init(attrs)
                          <attribute-value list> attrs;

                      Note: attrs is a NULL terminated attribute-
                      value list.

       xv_create()    Creates an object.

                      Xv_object
                      xv_create(owner, package, attrs)
                          Xv_object      owner;
                          Xv_pkg         package;
                          <attribute-value list> attrs;

       xv_destroy()   Destroys an object.

                      int
                      xv_destroy(object)
                          Xv_opaque object;

       xv_find()      Finds an object that meets  certain  crite-
                      ria;  or  if the object doesn't exist, cre-
                      ates it  (default  behavior  which  can  be
                      defeated using XV_AUTO_CREATE, FALSE).

                      Xv_opaque
                      xv_find(owner, package, attrs)
                          Xv_object      owner;
                          Xv_pkg         package;
                          <attribute-value list> attrs;

       xv_get()       Gets the value of a single attribute.

                      Xv_opaque
                      xv_get(object, attrs)
                          Xv_object     object;
                          <attribute-value list> attrs;

       xv_set()       Sets the value of one or more attributes.

                      Xv_opaque
                      xv_set(object, attrs)
                          Xv_object     object;
                          <attribute-value list> attrs;

   Internationalized Support
       XView  now  has  support  for  internationalization.  This
       includes locale  setting,  localized  text  handling,  and
       dynamic  object  layout.  See the XView Programming Manual
       for details.

   Command Line Resource Arguments
       XView-based applications display  characteristics  can  be
       controlled  by  supplying  command  line  arguments to the
       applications at start-up.  The usage is as follows:

       % program -argument1 value1 -argument2 value2...

       In the tables below, Argument(s) shows the short  argument
       followed  by  the long argument--either can be used.  Type
       describes the type of value  the  arguments  can  receive.
       Resource  describes  the  X  resource name modified by the
       arguments.  Default is  the  default  value.   Description
       describes what the arguments do.  Example shows an example
       of a command using the argument.


       Argument(s):   -Wx, or -scale
       Type:          string   ("small",    "medium",    "large",
                      "extra_large")
       Resource:      Window.Scale
       Default:       medium
       Description:   Sets  the  initial scale of the application
                      (larger or smaller).  small is  10  pixels,
                      medium is 12 pixels, large is 14 pixels and
                      extra_Large is 19  pixels.   The  font.name
                      resource will override the scale.
       Example:       cmdtool -scale extra_large

       Argument(s):   -Wt, -fn, or -font
       Type:          string
       Resource:      Font.Name
       Default:       lucidasans-12
       Description:   Sets  the  name  of  the  font used for the
                      application.  Does not  set  the  font  for
                      frame  header and frame menu header.  These
                      are controlled by the window  manager.   To
                      find  out what fonts are available, use the
                      xlsfonts(1) command.  If the font you spec-
                      ify  cannot be found, you will see an error
                      message such as:

                      XView warning: Cannot load font 'galant-24'
		      (Font package)

		      XView  warning:  Attempting  to  load  font
                      '-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-
                      sans-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*' instead (Font pack-
                      age)

       Example:       cmdtool -fn fixed

       Argument(s):   -Ws, or -size
       Type:          integer integer
       Resource:      Window.Width and Window.Height
       Default:       depends on application
       Description:   Sets  the  width and height of the applica-
                      tion's base frame.  The values are in  pix-
                      els.
       Example:       cmdtool -Ws 400 500

       Argument(s):   -Ww, or -width
       Type:          int (number of columns)
       Resource:      window.columns
       Default:       None
       Description:   Specifies  the  width,  in  columns, of the
                      application.
       Example:       cmdtool -width 40
                      (starts a command tool 40 columns wide)

       Argument(s):   -Wh, or -height
       Type:          int (number of columns)
       Resource:      window.rows
       Default:       None
       Description:   Specifies  the  height,  in  rows,  of  the
                      application.
       Example:       cmdtool -height 40
                      (starts a command tool 40 rows high)

       Argument(s):   -Wp, or -position
       Type:          integer integer
       Resource:      Window.X and Window.Y
       Default:       depends on window manager
       Description:   Sets  the  initial position of the applica-
                      tion's base frame  in  pixels.   The  upper
                      left  corner  of  the screen is at position
                      (0,0), with the x-axis  increasing  to  the
                      left,  and  the y-axis increasing downward.
                      These values will also be generated by  the
                      "Save  Workspace"  option  on the root menu
                      into  the  $HOME/.openwin-init  file   when
                      using the Open Look Window Manager.
       Example:       cmdtool -Wp 100 200

       Argument(s):   -WG, or -geometry
       Type:          string         of         the        format
                      <width>x<height>{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>
       Resource:      Window.Geometry
       Default:       depends on application and window manager
       Description:   This sets both the size and  the  placement
                      of   the  application's  base  frame.  This
                      option has  priority  over  the  -size  and
                      -position arguments. The size and placement
                      parts of the value are optional.   You  can
                      set  just  the  size, just the position, or
                      both.  The size values are measured in pix-
                      els,  and  the position values use the same
                      semantics as -position.   However,  if  you
                      use the '-' in front of an X value, it will
                      be taken as relative to the right hand side
                      of  the screen, instead of the left.  Like-
                      wise, if you use the '-' with the Y  value,
                      it  will be taken relative to the bottom of
                      the screen instead of the top.
       Examples:
                      cmdtool -geometry 500x600
                      (will make the base frame  500x600  pixels,
                      with  the  position  set by the window man-
                      ager)
                      cmdtool -WG +10+20
                      (will make the base frame of  default  size
                      with  the  left  hand  side of the frame 10
                      pixels from  the  left  hand  side  of  the
                      screen,  and the top of the frame 20 pixels
                      from the top of the screen)
                      cmdtool -WG -10+20
                      (will make the base frame of  default  size
                      with  the  right  hand side of the frame 10
                      pixels from the  right  hand  side  of  the
                      screen,  and the top of the frame 20 pixels
                      from the top of the screen)
                      cmdtool -geometry 400x300-0-0
                      (will make the base  frame  400x300  pixels
                      with the right hand side of the frame flush
                      against the right hand side of the  screen,
                      and  the bottom of the frame flush with the
                      bottom of the screen)

       Argument(s):   -WP, -icon_position
       Type:          integer integer
       Resource:      Icon.X Icon.Y
       Default:       depends on window manager
       Description:   Sets the position of the application's icon
                      in  pixels.   Uses  the  same  semantics as
                      -position for base frames.
       Example:       cmdtool -WP 400 20

       Argument(s):   -Wl, -label, or -title
       Type:          string
       Resource:      Window.Header
       Default:       N/A
       Description:   Sets a default label for the  base  frame's
                      header.  However, the application can over-
                      write this  setting  and  display  its  own
                      header.
       Example:       cmdtool -Wl "Header Text"

       Argument(s):   -Wi, and +Wi
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Window.Iconic
       Default:       +Wi
       Description:   Controls  how  an application will come up,
                      open or closed (iconified).
       Examples:      cmdtool +Wi       (will  make  the  cmdtool
                      come up open)
                      cmdtool  -Wi       (will  make  the cmdtool
                      come up closed)

       Argument(s):   -depth
       Type:          integer
       Resource:      Window.Depth
       Default:       Depth of server's default visual
       Description:   Specifies the depth of base frame.  If this
                      depth  is  not supported by the server, the
                      default depth will  be  used  instead.   If
                      this   is  specified  in  conjunction  with
                      -visual, then  the  exact  visual  will  be
                      used.
       Example:       cmdtool -depth 4

       Argument(s):   -visual
       Type:          string  (one  of  the  values:  StaticGray,
                      GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor,  True-
                      Color, or DirectColor).
       Resource:      Window.Visual
       Default:       Server's default visual
       Description:   Specifies  the  visual  class  of  the base
                      frame.   If  this  visual  class   is   not
                      supported by the server, the default visual
                      class will be used  instead.   If  this  is
                      specified  in conjunction with -depth, then
                      the exact visual will be used.
       Example:       cmdtool -visual StaticGray

       Argument(s):   -Wf, or -foreground_color
       Type:          integer integer integer
       Resource:      Window.Color.Foreground
       Default:       0 0 0
       Description    See Description in -Wb below.

       Argument(s):   -Wb, or -background
       Type:          integer integer integer
       Resource:      Window.Color.Background
       Default:       255 255 255
       Description:   These options allow the user to specify the
                      foreground  color  (e.g.,  the color of the
                      text in a textsw), or the background  color
                      (e.g.,  the  color that the text is painted
                      on) of an application.   The  three  values
                      should be integers between 0 and 255.  They
                      specify the amount of red, green  and  blue
                      that  is  in  the  color.   See -fg and -bg
                      below for information on similar functions.
       Example:       cmdtool -Wf 0 0 255 -Wb 100 100 100
                      (would come up with a blue foreground, with
                      a gray background)

       Argument(s):   -fg, or -foreground
       Type:          string (color name,  or  hexadecimal  color
                      specification)
       Resource:      Window.Color.Foreground
       Default:       black
       Description:   See Description in -bg below.

       Argument(s):   -bg, or -background
       Type:          string  (color  name,  or hexadecimal color
                      specification)
       Resource:      Window.Color.Background
       Default:       white
       Description:   These options are similar to  the  -Wf  and
                      -Wb  options, except that they take a color
                      argument in the form of a predefined  color
                      name   (lavender,  grey,  goldenrod,  etc.)
                      from $OPENWINHOME/lib/rbg.txt,  or  a  hex-
                      adecimal  representation.   The hexadecimal
                      representation is of the  form  pound  sign
                      (#) followed by the hexadecimal representa-
                      tion of the red, green and blue aspects  of
                      the color.
       Examples:      cmdtool -fg blue -bg gray
                      (comes  up  with  a blue foreground, with a
                      gray background)
                      cmdtool -fg #d800ff -bg white
                      (comes up with a purple foreground, with  a
                      white background)

       Argument(s):   -WI, or -icon_image
       Type:          string
       Resource:      Icon.Pixmap
       Default:       depends on application
       Description:   Sets  the  default  filename for the icon's
                      image.  However, the application can  over-
                      write this setting and display its own icon
                      image.  The file must be in XView icon for-
                      mat.   The  program  iconedit(1) will allow
                      one to create an image in the icon  format.
                      Several  icons  have  been  provided in the
                      directory $OPENWINHOME/include/images.   By
                      convention,  icon format files end with the
                      suffix .icon.
       Example:       cmdtool -WI /usr/include/images/stop.icon

       Argument(s):   -WL, or -icon_label
       Type:          string
       Resource:      Icon.Footer
       Default:       depends on application
       Description:   Sets a default label for the  base  frame's
                      icon.   However,  the application can over-
                      write this setting and display its own icon
                      label.
       Example:       cmdtool -WL "Icon Label"

       Argument(s):   -WT, or -icon_font
       Type:          string
       Resource:      Icon.Font.Name
       Default:       depends
       Description:   Sets  the  name  of  the  font used for the
                      application's icon.
       Example:       cmdtool -WT '*century schoolbook*'

       Argument(s):   -Wd, or -default
       Type:          string string
       Resource:      given by the first string
       Default:       none
       Description:   This  option  allows  the   user   to   set
                      resources  that  don't  have  command  line
                      equivalents.   The   format   is   -default
                      resource-name  value .  The XView resources
                      without specific command line arguments are
                      discussed in the following section.
       Example:       cmdtool          -default          OpenWin-
                      dows.ScrollbarPlacement left

       Argument(s):   -xrm
       Type:          string
       Resource:      given in the string
       Default:       none
       Description:   This  option  allows  the   user   to   set
                      resources  that  don't  have  command  line
                      equivalents.   This  is  similar   to   the
                      -default  option,  but  it  takes  only one
                      argument, a string in the form of resource-
                      name:value.
       Example:       cmdtool            -xrm            OpenWin-
                      dows.ScrollbarPlacement:right

       Argument(s):   -WH, or -help
       Type:          none
       Resource:      none
       Default:       none
       Description:   Prints a description  of  the  valid  xview
                      command line arguments for the application.

       Argument(s):   -sync or -synchronous, and +sync  or  +syn-
                      chronous
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Window.Synchronous
       Default:       +synchronous
       Description:   These options allow you to make the connec-
                      tion that the application has with the  X11
                      server  either synchronous (-sync) or asyn-
                      chronous (+sync).

       Argument(s):   -Wr, or -display
       Type:          string (host:display{.screen})
       Resource:      Server.Name
       Default:       taken from the DISPLAY environment variable
       Description:   Sets the name of the X11 server on which to
                      connect.  host is the name  or  address  of
                      the  machine  on whose server you have per-
                      mission to display.  display  is  a  number
                      corresponding  to  the  server  on which to
                      display for that machine, and screen corre-
                      sponds to which screen for the server.  See
                      reference manual page on xhost(1) for  more
                      details on adding to permissions list.
       Examples:      cmdtool -display foobar:0
                      (will  bring  up  a  cmdtool on the default
                      screen of the display #0 of host foobar)
                      cmdtool -display foobar:0.1
                      (will bring up a cmdtool on  screen  #1  of
                      display #0 of host foobar)

       Argument(s):   -Wdxio, or -disable_xio_error_handler
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      none
       Default:       enable xio handler--this option disables it
       Description:   This option  is  useful  for  debugging  an
                      application.  Whenever there is a fatal XIO
                      error,  the  server  will  print  an  error
                      message  before  exiting.  XView installs a
                      error handler to keep those  messages  from
                      appearing.   If you would like to see these
                      messages, use this option.

       Argument(s)    -rv (or -reverse), and +rv (or +reverse)
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Window.ReverseVideo
       Default:       False
       Description:   These options  control  whether  the  fore-
                      ground  and background colors of the appli-
                      cation will  be  reversed.   If  True,  the
                      foreground  and  background  colors will be
                      swapped.  The -rv flag  will  set  this  to
                      True,  while  the +rv will set it to False.
                      This is really only  useful  on  monochrome
                      displays.

       Argument(s):   -name
       Type:          string
       Resource:      None
       Default:       argv[0]
       Description:   Specifies the instance name of the applica-
                      tion. This name is used  to  construct  the
                      resource  name  used  to perform lookups in
                      the X11 Resource Manager to  look  for  the
                      values of customizable attributes.

   Internationalized Command Line Resource Arguments
       The  following  command  line  arguments  are  relevant to
       internationalization.  Locale refers to the  language  and
       cultural conventions used in a program.  Locale setting is
       the method by which the language and cultural  environment
       of a system is set. Locale setting affects the display and
       manipulation of language-dependent features.

       The internationalization features that XView now  supports
       include  locale setting. One of the ways locale can be set
       is with command line options. See  the  XView  Programming
       Manual for details on other methods.

       Argument(s):   -lc_basiclocale
       Type:          string
       Resource:      basicLocale
       Default:       "C"
       Description:   Specifies  the basic locale category, which
                      sets the country of the user interface.

       Argument(s):   -lc_displaylang
       Type:          string
       Resource:      displayLang
       Default:       "C"
       Description:   Specifies the display language locale cate-
                      gory,  sets  the  language in which labels,
                      messages, menu items,  and  help  text  are
                      displayed.

       Argument(s):   -lc_inputlang
       Type:          string
       Resource:      inputLang
       Default:       "C"
       Description:   Specifies  the  input language locale cate-
                      gory, sets the language used  for  keyboard
                      input.

       Argument(s):   -lc_numeric
       Type:          string
       Resource:      numeric
       Default:       "C"
       Description:   Specifies   the  numeric  locale  category,
                      which defines the language used  to  format
                      numeric quantities.

       Argument(s):   -lc_timeformat
       Type:          string
       Resource:      timeFormat
       Default:       "C"
       Description:   Specifies  the time format locale category,
                      which defines the language used  to  format
                      time and date.

   Command Line Options/X Resources for Debugging
       The following switches/resources can be used during devel-
       opment to avoid the locking up of screens or other effects
       of X grabs that are done by XView.

       It  should  be  noted  that these options/resources should
       only be used by developers and are not for  normal  usage.
       The  X  grabs  are done for a specific reason, and are not
       meant to be customizable.  Without the  X  grabs,  certain
       features in XView (those that depend on X grabs) might not
       function properly.

       Argument(s):   -Wfsdb, or -fullscreendebug
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Fullscreen.Debug
       Default:       FALSE
       Description:   Enables/disables fullscreen debugging  mode
                      during   which   X   grabs  (XGrabServer(),
                      XGrabKeyboard(),  XGrabPointer())  are  not
                      done.   When  using the fullscreen pkg, the
                      X11 server will be grabbed  which  prevents
                      other windows on the server from responding
                      until the grab has been released by the one
                      window  which initiated the grab.  Refer to
                      Appendix F in the XView Manual:  Converting
                      SunView Applications for further details.

       Argument(s):   -Wfsdbs, or -fullscreendebugserver
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Fullscreen.Debugserver
       Default:       FALSE
       Description:   Enables/disables  server  grabbing  (XGrab-
                      Server()) that is done via  the  fullscreen
                      pkg.   Refer to the Appendix F in the XView
                      Manual: Converting SunView Applications for
                      further details.

       Argument(s):   -Wfsdbk, or -fullscreendebugkbd
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Fullscreen.Debugkbd
       Default:       FALSE
       Description:   Enables/disables      keyboard     grabbing
                      (XGrabKeyboard())  that  is  done  via  the
                      fullscreen pkg.  Refer to the Appendix F in
                      the XView Manual: Converting SunView Appli-
                      cations for further details.

       Argument(s):   -Wfsdbp, or -fullscreendebugptr
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Fullscreen.Debugptr
       Default:       FALSE
       Description:   Enables/disables  pointer  grabbing (XGrab-
                      Pointer()) that is done via the  fullscreen
                      pkg.   Refer to the Appendix F in the XView
                      Manual: Converting SunView Applications for
                      further details.

       Argument(s):   -Wdpgs, or -disable_pass_grab_select
       Type:          boolean
       Resource:      Window.PassiveGrab.Select
       Default:       TRUE
       Description:   Disables  the  passive grab that is done on
                      the SELECT button.  XView  does  a  passive
                      grab  on  the  SELECT button to avoid input
                      focus race conditions.  When  this  passive
                      grab  is  disabled, input focus race condi-
                      tions may be seen.
       Example:       % cmdtool -disable_pass_grab_select
                      This executes a cmdtool that does not  per-
                      form  any  passive grabs on the SELECT but-
                      ton.   To  do  the  same  thing   using   X
                      resources, add the following entry to the X
                      resource database:
                      Window.PassiveGrab.Select:False

   .Xdefaults File
       The .Xdefaults file is used to store and retrieve resource
       settings.  We recommend, however, that you use the command
       line arguments described above in order to change  display
       characteristics.  Changing the resources in the .Xdefaults
       file will modify the  behaviour  of  the  user's  session.
       Novice  users  should  not casually hand modify these set-
       tings. Before attempting edits to this  file  please  read
       the appropriate sections of the Xlib Programming Manual on
       the file format and the specific properties you intend  to
       change.

       Note  that  resources documented below do not have command
       line arguments.  It is still possible, however, to  change
       them  without  altering the .Xdefaults file.  Refer to the
       command line arguments -xrm and -defaults for instructions
       on how to to this.  Additional resources that have command
       line arguments are documented in the previous section. For
       mouseless resources refer to the XView Programming Manual.

       The resources are documented in the following format:

       Resource:      Resource Name ( If the resource can be mod-
                      ified  by  the  OpenWindows Property Sheet,
                      the word Props will be present.)
       Values:        Possible Values, and/or Format of Values to
                      be Assigned to Resource (Default Value)
       Description    Description of Resource.

       Resource:      window.synchronous, +sync -sync
       Values:        True, False (False)
       Description    Useful  when  debugging  or tracking down a
                      problem since the error codes emitted  from
                      Xlib   will  correspond  to  the  immediate
                      request made.   Running  in  a  synchronous
                      mode will cause the application to run sig-
                      nificantly slower.

       Resource:      mouse.modifier.button2
       Values:        Shift,  Ctrl,  any  valid  modifier  keysym
                      (Shift)
       Description    When  using  a  mouse  with less than three
                      buttons, this resource gets  an  equivalent
                      mapping  for the second button which is the
                      ADJUST button on a three button mouse.  For
                      more   information   on  keysyms,  see  the
                      xmodmap(1) reference manual page, Xlib doc-
                      umentation,  and the include file $OPENWIN-
                      HOME/include/X11/Xkeymap.h.

       Resource:      mouse.modifier.button3
       Values:        Shift,  Ctrl,  any  valid  modifier  keysym
                      (Ctrl)
       Description    When  using  a  mouse  with less than three
                      buttons, this resource gets  an  equivalent
                      mapping  for  the third button which is the
                      MENU button on a three  button  mouse.  For
                      more   information   on  keysyms,  see  the
                      xmodmap reference manual page,  Xlib  docu-
                      mentation,    and    the    include    file
                      $OPENWINHOME/include/X11/Xkeymap.h.

       Resource:      OpenWindows.beep (Props)
       Values:        never, notices, always (always)
       Description    When the value is notices, the audible bell
                      will ring only when a notice pops up.  When
                      the value is never, the audible  bell  will
                      never  ring.  When the value is always, the
                      audible bell will always ring when the bell
                      function is called by a program.

       Resource:      alarm.visible
       Values:        True, False (True)
       Description    When  ringing the bell in an XView program,
                      flash the window as well to alert the user.

       OpenWindows.windowColor (Props)
       Values:        any  valid  X11  color specification (#ccc-
                      ccc--80% grey)
       Description    Specify the base color  for  control  areas
                      for  3-D look.  Takes hexadecimal represen-
                      tation.  Three other colors used for  shad-
                      ing  and  highlighting are calculated based
                      upon the value  of  the  specified  control
                      color.   The  actual  calculated values are
                      done by the OLGX library to provide a  con-
                      sistent color calculation between XView and
                      OLWM.   The  desktop   properties   program
                      allows  a  full  range of customization and
                      previews what the chosen 3-D look will look
                      like.   Does  not  apply to monochrome dis-

       Resource:      text.delimiterChars
       Values:        string                                   ('
                      \011!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~')
       Description    This resource allows the user to select the
                      delimiter  characters  that  are  used when
                      doing word level selections  in  the  XView
                      package.  It was added because of the needs
                      of the international  marketplace,  and  it
                      allows  the user to define the local delim-
                      iters for the character set that  is  being
                      used  with  the  current  keyboard  and Sun
                      workstation.

                      Note  that  the  octal  characters  can  be
                      scrambled  by  Xrm  during a rewrite of the
                      value of text.delimiter.Chars.  Xrm  inter-
                      prets the text.delimiterChar string when it
                      is loaded.  Specifically it will decode the
                      backslashed portions of the string and con-
                      vert them to octal  representations.   When
                      this  is  passed to the client application,
                      the logic will  function  correctly.   How-
                      ever,  this  misbehavior  of Xrm causes the
                      string to be stored incorrectly if the user
                      saves  the  .Xdefaults  file  using the Xrm
                      content of the string. The  specific  prob-
                      lem(s)  that occur are the stripping of the
                      backslash characters and the  expansion  of
                      the tab character (\011).

                      To  correct  this  problem, one can put the
                      text.delimiterChar entry into an .Xdefaults
                      file that will not be overwritten when sav-
                      ing the workspace properties (for  example,
                      a system wide defaults file).  Or a copy of
                      the   text.delimiterChar   entry   can   be
                      inserted after .Xdefaults file saves.

                      text package will send a notice to the user
                      to tell them that no  more  insertions  are
                      possible.   If  the  file  being  edited is
                      saved to a file, or it is a disk file being
                      edited, then the limit does not apply.

       Description    Where N is an integer between 0  and  2000.
                      Specifies  the  margin  in  pixels that the
                      text should maintain between the left  hand
                      border  of the window and the first charac-
                      ter on each line.

       Resource:      text.margin.right
       Values:        N (0)
       Description    Where N is an integer between 0  and  2000.
                      Specifies  the  margin  in  pixels that the
                      text should maintain between the right hand
                      border of the window and the last character
                      on each line.

       Resource:      text.tabWidth
       Values:        N (8)
       Description    Where N is an integer  between  0  and  50.

                      tab character.

       Resource:      Text.LineSpacing
       Values:        N (0)
       Description    Where N is an integer which is the percent-
                      age of the maximum height of a character in
                      the Textsw window font to use as  interline
                      spacing.   Setting  Text.LineSpacing  to  a
                      nonzero positive number will  increase  the
                      size  of a Textsw proportionally.  xv_set()
                      of WIN_ROWS will still  yield  the  correct
                      number  of  rows.  However, the window will
                      be taller as  compared  to  a  Textsw  with
                      Text.LineSpacing  set  to 0.  This resource
                      allows XView to  conform  to  TUV  require-
                      ments.    To  meet  TUV  requirements,  set
                      Text.LineSpacing to 15 or greater.
