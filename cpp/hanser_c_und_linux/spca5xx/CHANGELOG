The spca500 from FamilyCam and pocket DV also i think clicksmart510 need to initialise with the size set to 640x480 and the corresponding
usb pipe set to 1023.Unfortunately our driver start with the smallest one.I have made a change to allow these cams to work with all size
640x480 320x240 and 176x144 the large size auto init without unplug and replug the cam the others need that:(
Need more test for the pocketDV owner.
23/11/2003

All the crop feature are now implemented and work fine for the spca504a and spca504b camera
the spca533a work fine in 320x240 194x144 176x144 the others want the multiply and is not implemented ATM
I hope this code have not break the others cam.If you got problem or working please feedback to mxhaard@magic.fr
The hint message have move to "SPCA5XX Usb Camera" to allow all the palette working on gnomemeeting.
Thanks to Damien Sandras and Fabrice (Gnomemeeting Team) for help and testing the YUV420P feature.
A preliminary code to drop frame is also implemented this drop occurs when the userspace ask for RGB
in full size 640x480 like "gqcam".
(That is not really a good idea, we want 18.43Mb/s to push a whole frame in RGB24 and the kernel didn't like that:) )
a better idea is to use yuv420p with spcaview that need only 9.21 Mb/s with the same quality.
IMHO the decoder to RGB feature didn't have a place in a Linux kernel:)
This module need a good processor to work fine and is optimize for i686 familly ( PIV and Athlon)

Start to implement the output feature for sif qsif cif qcif vga qpal
Encode the struct spca5xx_ext_mode to allow a hardware width and heigth
and a software methode the lower nibble give the code for hardware the height
give the method 0-> nothing 1-> cropping 2-> divide 4-> multiply
value1 give a X value and value2 give the Y.
cropping method
each X or Y value is used for a macroblock 16x16 pixels if X is not odd
then the first crop begin at the left is more shorter (1) than the other
each crop is perform in center method.
divide
divide is a crop pixel on the surface and is perform in X width and Y height
multiply
add a new pixel every X in the width axis (need for the spca533a)

FIX a bug in spca50x_read function producer to comsumer if the comsumer ask n bytes the producer give n bytes.
That fix the read function with spcaview in yuv420p and rawjpeg data
29/10/2003
Add VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB565 for the rawjpeg camera
21/10/2003
Expand the macro of IDCT to remove a lot of exchange perform IMULT with long
Start to implement crop feature for rawjpeg cam this will need for all the resolutions
20/10/2003
Test the idct and profile to get best performance now work best with full size in real times 16fps in my Athlon
2.2Ghz
15/10/2003
rewrite the rgb decoder for 24 and 32 bits; you can change the color space in the code uncomment the relevant
line in jpegdecoder.c
initcol() is not need because break the yuv colors space.
14/10/2003
some cleanup rewrite the main loop of jpegdecode
seem the huffman/idct in large with a good light take about 3ms
13/10/2003
rearrange the jpegdecode function look at the UV plan and remove the rescale when
YUVP is asked ( work with large resolution in low light, need optimisations)
11/10/2003
Implement YUV420P for the spca500 spca504a spca504b spca533a in libjpeg decoder
unlock VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P in spca50x for those chips (2628)

Help with the code found on Macam project (Mac OSX)

* Temporary fixes for the Intel Pocket PC Camera and the DSC-350. Both
  cameras are spca500a based, and require a qtable to be defined. The
  temporary fix makes these two cameras use the Creative PC-CAM 300 qtable,
  but ideally, they would use the same qtable as the windows driver
  (polesworth).
* Support for spca504 based cams with a firmware version 2 (spca504b) (mxhaard).
* Conditionally follow memory management API changes backported to 2.4.20 
  in redhat 9 (Chris Parker <chris.parker@marinerhealthcare.com>).
* Imported Creative PC-CAM 600 patches from <http://www.galeon.com/scartwb/>
  by <scar_t_@hotmail.com>, and tidied them up (polesworth).
* Ratified spca504 code to use the same Q-table support code as spca500,
  and moved all Q-tables into their own header file (polesworth).
* Fix for WOLT kernel. pte_offset changed to pte_offset_kernel (polesworth).
* Fix for a link error. The option '--relocateable' doesn't exist in all
  versions of ld. Instead, use '-r' which should work on all platforms
  (pancake <pancake@phreaker.net>).
* Support for the Hama USB Sightcam 100 (tgc).
* Added missing entries for Aiptek MegaCam (polesworth).
* Support for the Arowana 300k CMOS Camera (Daniele Gozzi - codeatnight).
* Makefile cleanups (Anders Kaseorg - anders1).
* Added support for (mxhaard):
  - Aiptek PocketDVII 1.3;
  - Aiptek Pencam SD 2M;
  - Mustek MDC5500Z;
  - Megapix V4;
  - Aiptek PocketDV;
  - Mystery Camera (from Ori).
* Cleaned up internal camera id allocation, including removal of unnecessary
  checks against USB vendor/device id (polesworth).
* Various tidying up - mainly white space changes (polesworth).
* Merged in patch #802598 (SPCA561 alpha support), which provides support
  for the Genius VideoCAM Express V2 (spca561a) (enjolras).
* Reformatting changes, mainly in spca50x.h (polesworth).

Release 0.30

------------
This release coordinated by Miah Gregory (polesworth) and Till Adam (tillsan).

Binary and source packages available for this release.

Changes in this release:
* Fixes for compilation against 2.4.20 kernels (polesworth).
* Couple of fixups for gcc 3.2 pedantics (polesworth).
* Fixed destroy proc debug code, which used an uninitialised variable 'name'.
  Now the variable is displayed after it has been initialised (Andrea Mennucc).
* Added support for spca504 based cameras (tillsan, feber).
* Added support for spca500 based cameras (polesworth).
* As part of the spca500/spca504 support, added jpeg decompression code
  (feber, polesworth, tillsan).
* Increased MAX_FRAME_SIZE to allow 32 bit V4L modes (tillsan).
* Changed default debug level to 0 (polesworth).
* Added raw proc entry support - useful for debugging (polesworth).
* Added support for:
  - Mustek gSmart mini 2;
  - Mustek gSmart mini 3;
  - Creative PC-CAM 300;
  - D-Link DSC-350;
  - Creative PC-CAM 600;
  - Intel Pocket PC Camera.
* Fix deadlock when shutting down the camera while used by a program (feber).
* Merged in patch #505324 (Patch for the Intel PC Camera CS110) (polesworth).
* Merged in patch #589680 (Prelim 3Com HomeConnect Lite Support) (polesworth).
* Fixed spca50x_probe, which was handling some cameras with known vendor
  ids but unknown device ids incorrectly. Found this bug whilst looking into
  support for the Kodak EZ200 (polesworth).
* Fixed driver to select smallest available resolution for a particular
  bridge, rather than using a hardcoded value (polesworth).
* Tidied up the jpeg decoder, which turned out to be including userspace
  header files, and added a return value to jpeg_decode (polesworth).
* spca500: changing mode now works correctly (polesworth).
* spca500: enabled subsampling for modes smaller than 640x480 (polesworth).
* spca500: added rudimentary picture quality controls (polesworth).
* Added support for the Kodak EZ200 camera, which is spca500 based (polesworth).
* Added in some changes for spca505 and maybe spca506 which apparently make
  the brightness levels usable (Keith MacLeod / Eric Preston).

Release 0.20
------------
This release coordinated by Miah Gregory (polesworth).

For this release, it was decided to package up source only, and not binaries.
This will change in the future, once the driver stabilises.

Changes in this release:
* Fix bug with probe function handling in kernels > 2.3.x (Leonardo Milano).
* Removed XawTV hack (use XawTV >= 3.65) (Leonardo Milano/korovkin).

* Added some experimental code for brightness autoadjustment (korovkin).
* Change from tq_scheduler to schedule_task (dscottie).
* Quick fix for Gnomemeeting/PWLib problems seen on SPCA50X;
  VIDIOCSWIN sets size of frame[0] to new size (dscottie).
* Forced driver to say which resolutions it supports, in order to force
  gnomemeeting to emulate the mode, if it's not supported.
* Added control proc entry, which allows the user to change driver parameters
  without reinserting the module (korovkin).
* Added "whiteness" autoadjustment feature (korovkin).
* Fixed bug in VIDIOCSPICT ioctl handling in SPCA501 (korovkin).
* Fixed bridge type check in spca50x_close (korovkin).
