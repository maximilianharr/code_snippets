plug the cam
as root :
	lsmod
	spca5xx should be load with videodev, if not, somethings goes wrong,
	verify that your cam is supported if not and you are sure for a Sunplus
	chip goto irc.freenode.net channel #spca50x and ask for help
	if yes run spcaview with this parameters (maybe read the readme is the
	best)
	spcaview -d /dev/video0 -f yuv
