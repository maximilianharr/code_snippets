Dear users,
For some strange reason "Luca Risolia" is setting a lot of drivers inside the main
Kernel tree, specially those chips supported by spca5xx. Maybe there are not enought hardware to Hack:)
As a consequence, you have to choice between spca5xx or the others. The problem is, hotplug will detect, the in kernel driver
and maybe  reject spca5xx claim.
If you load the spca5xx first with 
modprobe spca5xx
there are no problem.
You can also blacklist the in kernel driver:)

.If you get problem with the main kernel drivers, don't ask me please, you should ask here to get help: 
linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net 
or here for the v4l2 features :)
video4linux-list@redhat.com
