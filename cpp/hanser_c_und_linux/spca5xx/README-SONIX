Dear spca5xx users,
If you have compiled the sn9c102 driver from the main kernel tree, you should get
a conflict with spca5xx and sonix sn9c101 or sonix sn9c102 webcams.
you can :
a)load the spca5xx before plug your webcam with 
modprobe spca5xx
that way the sn9c102 kernel module did not load and you can benefit of the large
V4L support
b)rename the sn9c102.ko to sn9c102.ko.old in
/lib/modules/kernel-name/kernel/drivers/usb/media/
then run the command depmod -ae
Regards
