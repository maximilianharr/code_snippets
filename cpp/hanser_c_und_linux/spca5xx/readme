Disclaimer
==========
We believe that this driver will perform correctly in many circumstances.
It is, however, experimental code, running at the kernel level, and may
potentially cause serious data corruption, or worse.

Do not use this driver unless you are prepared for this eventuality.

Use of this driver constitutes an agreement that no-one other than yourself may
be held responsible for any effects caused by the driver, ill or otherwise.

This list represents those cameras that are specifically supported by the
driver, and should work to some degree 'out of the box'. A full list of the
cameras known to the project maintainers can be found on
http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html.


How do I use it?
================

Well, first you need to compile the driver (see below), then you need to make
sure that the v4l infrastructure is set up and then load the driver. After
you've done that, any v4l enabled application, such as spcaview, gqcam, xawtv,
gnomemeeting, camE etc should work.


Supported kernel versions
=========================
The driver should compile and run successfully against most stable versions of
the official Linux kernel (from <http://www.kernel.org/>), within the range
2.4.10 to 2.6.14 inclusive. exept kernel 2.4.22, 2.4.23,  2.6.3 
		--------------------------------------------------------
		-Distro patched Kernel should work but are unsupported.-
		--------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, it has been tested against:
 2.4.10		 Compiles ok, with 1 warning
 2.4.25		 Compiles ok, with 1 warning.	
 2.4.26		 Compiles ok, with 1 warning.
 2.4.31		 Compiles ok, with 1 warning.	
/lib/modules/2.4.25/build/include/linux/highmem.h: Dans la fonction « bh_kmap »:
/lib/modules/2.4.25/build/include/linux/highmem.h:20: attention : usage en arithmétique d'un pointeur de type « void * »
Don't care module should load and works fine :)
 2.6.7		 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.8.1	 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.9		 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.11.7	 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.12.6	 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.13		 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.14		 Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.15 rc6	Compiles ok, with no warnings.
 2.6.15.4	Compiles ok, with no warnings.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< KERNEL 2.4.22 2.4.23 2.6.3 are UNSUPPORTED !!>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Compiling it
============
The driver module can be built without modifying your kernel source tree.

Before trying to compile the driver, ensure that you've configured your
kernel, and updated the dependencies:
'make [config|menuconfig|xconfig]; make dep'.

Make sure, when compiling the driver, you use the same version of compiler as
was used to compile your kernel. Not doing so can create incompatible binaries.

If you wish to compile the driver against a kernel other than the currently
installed one, build the driver with
'make KINCLUDE=/usr/src/linux-<version>/include', or similar.

Please note, the default location for the kernel, according to the driver, is
/usr/src/linux.

To build just the driver, simply use 'make'.
Compiling against the linux kernel 2.4 source tree, there should be no
warnings at all.


This version of the driver offers an automatic installation facility.
Use 'make install' to have the driver installed into your kernel modules
directory, which is assumed to be /lib/modules/<version>/kernel/drivers/usb.
<version> is picked up from the currently running kernel, so if that's not
the right place, then don't use 'make install'!


Making sure the usb and v4l stuff is there
==========================================
For the module to function correctly, the video for linux subsystem needs to
be loaded. As root, check the output of lsmod for videodev. If its not there,
do: modprobe videodev.
Also, you need to make sure that the usbcore module is loaded (or compiled
into your kernel) and similarly the module appropriate for your usb controller
(uhci or ohci).


Loading it
==========
If you have compiled the module, but haven't done 'make install' you can load
the module in the top build directory by doing as root: insmod spca5xx.o

If you have made install, do as root: modprobe spca5xx

There are several parameter that can be passed in:

  force_rgb = 1 Set reverse rgb order
  OffRed    = -16 Initial red   offset -16  range [-128..+128]
  OffBlue   = -16 Initial blue  offset -16  range [-128..+128]
  OffGreen  = -16 Initial green offset -16  range [-128..+128]
  GRed      = 256 Initial gain setting to 1 range [0..512]
  GBlue     = 256 Initial gain setting to 1 range [0..512] 
  GGreen    = 256 Initial gain setting to 1 range [0..512] 
  gamma     = 3 Set gamma table to 1 range [0..7]
  
  usbgrabber = 1 if you use an usb grabber usbid 0x0733:0x430 otherwise
  usbgrabber=0
 
  debug=<n>   <-- set debug level 
  
 special note for kernel 2.6.x users:
 you can change the parameters trought sysfs you need to be root
close your application
	echo "1" > /sys/module/spca50x/gamma
	change the gamma parameters to 1
run your application
	to read a parameters
	cat /sys/module/spca50x/gamma
	
	

***********************************************************************
Remember to use
   insmod spca5xx.o usbgrabber=1 for an usb grabber usbid 0x733:0x430
for Intel PC Camera Pro set usbgrabber to 0 in webcam mode 
***********************************************************************



Trying a v4l app
================
Spcaview or Spcagui are designed to test our driver http://mxhaard.free.fr .
have a look at the readme for all parameters setting.

You can also try gnomemeeting, or any other v4l program, they should
Just Work (TM).


How about downloading pictures from it, or videos?
==================================================
This driver is a v4l driver, whose scope is only streaming video. Support for
downloading images and movies for a lot of spca50x cameras is provided as part
of the gphoto2 project, which can be found at: <http://www.gphoto.org>.


Limitations and known problems
==============================
Support for some bridges is not complete yet. 
Not all resolutions work. 
The driver as a whole is experimental. 


What to do if your cam doesn't work
==================================
Scenario 1 - bridge not supported yet:
  If your cam sports a sunplus spca5 something chip which we do not support
  yet, you are in for some quality entertainment. :) In order to add support
  for your chip we will need snoops of the windows driver in operation. You
  can get these using a tool called ,usbsnoop  which is free
  software and can be found here: http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/.
  Once you have acquired these, send an email to the mailing list at
  <spca50x-devs@lists.sourceforge.net> or<mxhaard at magic dot fr>, detailing where/how people can
  download the snoops (eg. website/ftp/email) and if time permits, we'll take
  a look at them and try to implement support.
  If you are a developer yourself and want to help, we very much appreciate
  your contribution and will be happy to explain and answer questions about
  how the driver works.

Scenario 2 - bridge supported, but your cam isn't detected
  It might just work, but it also might not :). You can try exchanging your
  usb vendor and product id for those of a camera with the same chip in the
  source, or ask one of us to do it for you on the list or on irc. If the cam
  is like the others with the same chip, it might work and your ids can be
  permanently added. If it doesn't, see scenario one for what to do.

Scenario 3 - bridge supported, ids there, but still no luck
  random list of things to check:
    - make sure videodev is there;
    - make sure the usb stuff is working;
    - make sure the usb subsystem detects your cam;
    - check syslog, if the driver claims the device;
    - load the module with debug=4 and check syslog for some extremely verbose
      debug information;
    - write to the list or drop into #spca50x on freenode (IRC) and we'll see
      if we can get you up and running. :)


This is a mighty fine project, how can I learn more about it?

Thanks to all the authors of the ov511 driver and its ancestors.
Thanks to Darrell Scott for debug assistance and suggestions.
Thanks to Razvan Surdulescu for kicking me back into action.
Thanks to Bill Roehl for traces on the Create and Share (id 0x401). I WILL
            make this work... or die trying...
Thanks to everyone who has tested this driver and given me feedback on it.


A note on Sunplus Z-star Vimicro Conexant Sonix Transvision Etoms Pixart Mars-Semi and our interaction with them so far
======================================================================================================================
Several of us have tried, at various times, to obtain information on the
bridge and sensors chips from these Manufacturers, but have failed, seemingly due to a lack of
interest to cooperate on their part. Therefore, this driver is the result of
reverse engineering the protocols and functionality provided by these chips.
This limits what we can do, and it limits the quality of the driver. We would
much prefer to fully support all the features the chips provide, but without
Manufacturers supplying us with the needed specifications and technical
documentation, this is unlikely to happen.

Both the free software community and Manufacturer(s) could only benefit from improved
cooperation in the future.
